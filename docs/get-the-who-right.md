# Get the Who Right

??? quote "Today's Scripture - Matthew 6:26, NIV"

    *"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"*

We all face challenges in life that we don’t know how they’re going to work out. How am I going to get well? How am I going to meet the right person? How is this dream going to come to pass? But here’s the key: The HOW is not as important as the WHO. When you know who you are, a child of the Most High God, crowned with favor, with royal blood flowing through your veins, then the WHO will override the HOW. Your Heavenly Father created the universe and has ways of doing things that you can’t see. When you understand that you belong to Him, you can live from a place of peace, knowing that your Father has a solution to that problem that’s stressing you out. The HOW may look impossible, but that is not up to you. If you stay focused on HOW, you’re going to live worried and discouraged. Your job is to honor God, to be your best, and He will take care of the HOW.

## A Prayer for Today

*"Father, thank You that just as You feed the birds of the air, You will provide me with exactly what I need for every season I am in. I choose to rest, knowing that You are in control of the HOW. I declare I will not worry because You supply all my needs. In Jesus’ Name, Amen."*
