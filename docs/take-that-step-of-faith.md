# Take That Step of Faith

??? quote "Today's Scripture - John 5:8, NLT"

    *Jesus told him, "Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk!"

Andrew, in John 5, when Jesus asked a disabled man, “Do you want to get well?” he made excuses and tried to justify his condition rather than answering, “Yes, that’s what I’m believing for.” After thirty-eight discouraging years of having this disability, the man had gotten comfortable in his dysfunction and lost his passion to be well. But when he heard Jesus’ call to do the impossible and rise up and walk, something rose up in him to try, and against all odds a sudden strength came into his legs and he was instantly healed.

As with this man, God is going to ask you to do things that you don’t think you can do. In your own ability, you can’t, but when you take that step of faith, God will step in and give you supernatural ability. That’s because there’s favor in your calling. In your calling, you’ll break addictions, beat the cancer, and defeat the depression. God is saying, “I’m calling you up higher, into abundance, into freedom. I’m calling you into new levels.”

## A Prayer for Today

*“Father, thank You that with Your calling upon my life comes the power to release any old thinking, old habits, discouragement, and dysfunction that would keep me stuck. I’m dropping the excuses that hold me back and taking steps of faith for a new beginning today. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.”*
