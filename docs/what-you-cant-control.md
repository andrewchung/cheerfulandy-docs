!!! quote "Today's Scripture - Psalm 138:8, NLT"
    
    *The LORD will work out his plans for my life--for your faithful love, O LORD, endures forever.*

# What You Can't Control

Sometimes, we're frustrated because we're trying to control things that only God can control. We're trying to figure something out that there is no answer to right now. That's when we get frustrated and can't sleep at night. The good news is, God doesn't ask us to figure everything out. You have to knw what's your job and what's God's job. Our job is to believe, our job is to thank God, our job is to walk in obedience. God's job is to work things out that we can't work out. You're not on your own. The Creator of the universe is working out His plan for your life. His job is to open doors we can't open. His job is to part Red Seas. His job is to heal sick bodies.

Are you frustrated because you're trying to do God's job? Take the pressure off. You don't have to make everything happen. You just have to stay faithful, keep being good to people, and keep God first place. Your time is coming. God always works out His plans.

## A Prayer for Today

*"Father, thank You that what lies ahead and is unknown to me is well known to You. I choose to stop trying to control what only you can control and leave it in Your hands. I trust that You will go before me with Your plan and get me to where I'm supposed to be. In Jesus' Name, Amen."*
