# Inivisble

??? quote "Today's Scripture - 1 Samuel 23:14, NLT"

    *"Saul hunted him day after day, but God didn’t let Saul find him."*

David was living on the run from King Saul in the Desert of Ziph. He had only done good to Saul, but Saul had become so jealous of David that he was obsessed with killing him. Sometimes when you’re doing the right thing, being good to people, the favor on your life will stir up jealousy in other people. David was hiding in caves, doing his best to not get caught. Saul had skilled soldiers who were well equipped, and some were specifically trained in tracking people. David was badly outnumbered and didn’t have any professional training. It seemed as though he would be easily captured. But the Scripture says, “God didn’t let Saul find him.” God knows how to hide you from trouble, hide you from an accident, hide you from people who are trying to bring you down. Just as He can make blind eyes see, He can make seeing eyes blind. Live from a place of faith that He knows how to make you invisible to the enemy, to people, and to circumstances that want to harm you.

## A Prayer for Today

*"Father, thank You for being my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust. Thank You for Your promise of protecting me when troubles come and placing me out of its reach. I will live from a place of peace, knowing that You know how to make me invisible to the enemy. In Jesus’ Name, Amen."*
