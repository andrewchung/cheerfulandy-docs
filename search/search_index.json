How am I going to meet the right person? How is this dream going to come to pass? But here\u2019s the key: The HOW is not as important as the WHO. When you know who you are, a child of the Most High God, crowned with favor, with royal blood flowing through your veins, then the WHO will override the HOW. Your Heavenly Father created the universe and has ways of doing things that you can\u2019t see. When you understand that you belong to Him, you can live from a place of peace, knowing that your Father has a solution to that problem that\u2019s stressing you out. The HOW may look impossible, but that is not up to you. If you stay focused on HOW, you\u2019re going to live worried and discouraged.

Have vision and consistently set clear intentions for who you want to be each day, how you want to interact with others, what skills you must develop to win in the future, and how you can make a difference and serve with excellence. Never enter a situation without thinking through these four categories (self, social, skills, service).</li> <li>Determine the Feeling You're After. Ask yourself frequently, \"What is the primary feeling I want to bring to this situation, and what is the primary feeling I want to get from this situation?\"</li> <li>Define What's Meaningful. Not everything that is achievable is important, and so achievement is not the issue--alignment is.

Use transitions between activities to renew your energy. Do this by closing your eyes, practicing deep breathing, and releasing tension in your body and thoughts in your mind. Try to do this at least once every hour. Once you feel tension lift, set a clear intention for your next activity, open your eyes, and get to work with vibrant focus.</li> <li>Bring the joy. Be responsible for the energy you bring to your day and each situation in life. Focus especially on bringing joy to your activities. Anticipate positive outcomes from your actions, ask yourself questions that generate positive emotions, set triggers to remind you to be positive and grateful, and appreciate the small things and the people around you.</li> <li>Optimize Health. If the demands of your life require you to learn quickly, deal with stress, be alert, pay attention, remember important things, and keep a positive mood, then you must take sleep, exercise, and nutrition more seriously. Work with your doctor and other professionals to optimize your health. You already know things you should be doing.

You cannot become extraordinary without a sense that it's absolutely necessary to excel, for yourself and for others. From now on, whenever you sit down at your desk, ask: \"Who needs me on my A game the most right now? What about my identity and external obligations makes it imperative for me to deliver today?\"</li> <li>Affirm the Why. When you verbalize something, it becomes more real and important to you. Speak your \"why\" to yourself out loud often, and share it with others. This will motivate you to live in congruence with your commitments. So the next time you want to increase your performance necessity, declare--to yourself and others--what you want and why you want it.</li> <li>Level Up Your Squad. Emotions and excellence are contagious, so spend more time with the most positive and successful people in your peer group.

Determine the outputs that matter the most in determining your success, differentiation, and contribution to your field or industry.

Ask, \"If there were only five major moves to make that goal happen, what would they be?\" Think of each major move as a big bucket of activities, a project.
